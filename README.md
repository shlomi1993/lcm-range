# Least Common Multiple Range

This repo documents a small program that calculates a least common multiple (LCM) of a range between two given integers. I've implemented it as part of Algebraic Structures course at Bar-Ilan university.

## Program Parts

The program has three parts:
1. compute_gcd - compute a Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers.
2. compute_lcm - using compute_gcd to compute the Leaset Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers.
3. compute_lcm_range - using compute_lcm to compute LCM of a range of numbers.

## Language

- Python3
